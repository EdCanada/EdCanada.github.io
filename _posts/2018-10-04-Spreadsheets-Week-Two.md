Spreadsheets Week 2

This week we began learning how to code a Caesar Cipher in Google Sheets. Which I must admit can be very tricky because firstly you must create a very large data sheet which when you have never used spreadsheets before can take up to 10 minutes and then you must use a function called vlookup. I also learnt another function this week called iferror which means that when there's an error in the code it doesnâ€™t appear with some ugly comment saying #ERROR.
